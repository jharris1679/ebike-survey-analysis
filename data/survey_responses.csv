(eg. width, weight, speed)","Sidewalks are a safe place for bicycles and electric assist e-bikes--much safer than motor vehicle roadways. But ALL users of sidewalks (including pedestrians distracted by ipods of cell phones etc.) have a responsibility to be aware of their surroundings and watch out for their own and others safety. A cyclist or runner or skater must slow down and provide ample warning to others on the sidewalk--""Do unto others...""","All devices (high speed wheel chairs, e-bikes, in-line skates, bicycles, etc.) must be operated responsibly. Individuals must be made responsible for the safety of all. Perhaps the City can post ""Rules of the Road"" for trails and bike paths and sidewalks--No passing at more than a walking speed; Provide an audible notice of intent to pass (e.g., call out ""Bike on your right"" when contemplating a pass on the right side of a slower moving individual); Stop and/or move off the trail or sidewalk when meeting an individual with lesser mobility (e.g., baby stroller, wheelchair, walker, etc.); ...The bottom line is that when 2 individuals with highly different speeds collide there will be damage. A bicycle hitting a car or a Mack truck will result in more damage than a runner hitting a pedestrian. Pedestrians, wheelchair passengers, and bicyclists have no protective ""cocoon"" around them like a motor vehicle passenger. Motor vehicles (i.e., cars and trucks, not bicyles or e-bikes) should not mix with other less massive, less protective, and less speedy forms of transportation. And all forms of transportation sharing a common thoroughfare must be courteous and responsible for everyone's safety. I am nearly 65 years old. I used to ride a 10 speed bicycle about 10 km. to work, but I can't make it up some of the hills now. Fortunately the Province of Ontario had the foresight to allow something called an ""e-bike"" to be used like a bicycle and I can now ride my e-bike to work using the electric assist on hills I can't negotiate under my own steam. I ride on a few sidestreets with very little traffic, on the Waterfront Trail, through unofficial ""trails"" in fields, and occassionally on sidewalks rather than busy 4-lane roads. I am careful to slow down and move off the trail whenever I encounter another individual. I have never had any sort of problem meeting a pedestrian, baby stroller, other cyclist, etc. The only times I have witnessed a problem is when one individual is travelling at high speed overtaking another with no regard for the safety of others. It has nothing to do with the mode of transportation, it is a problem of a lack of responsiblity and respect for others in a specific individual. Perhaps better education at home, in school, and through posted ""Rules of the Road"" would help change this bad behaviour."

Plus they don't go as fast as cars which makes them too slow for the roads and well going slow on any type of bike is probably a good thing as there is nothing between you and the pavement.
